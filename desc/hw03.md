For this assignemnt, you will complete a program that takes an input file in a Markdown-like format and prints it to the Linux console with colors added.

 * Top level headings (“#”) should be have a magenta background.
 * Second level headings (“##”) should have a cyan background.
 * References, in square brackets (“[55]”) should be blue.
Run “cat tests/07b.txt” for sample output.

There’s one big complication: For this assignment you won’t be using the C standard library. Instead you’ll be making system calls directly using assembly code and writing any utility functions you need yourself.

C code should go in colorize.c

Assembly code should go in lib.S, following the genral style shown in class (GNU-style syntax, enter/leave for each function, strictly follow the calling conventions, etc).

Your program should build with the included make file. You should have no “#include” lines in your C code and your code should build with no warnings.

You can run the tests locally with “perl test.pl”. Make sure to delete any binaries (with “make clean”) before submitting to Inkfish.
