For this assignment, you will have the opportunity to redo a previous assignment.

##### Read the instructions carefully.

Instructions:

 * Select any previous assignment and make another attempt at completing it for a better score.
 * Submit your new solution to the assignment you redid. You will get a zero for a very late submission.
 * Submit a txt or markdown file to this submission with a link to your new submission to the redone assignment (i.e. https://inkfish.homework.quest/subs/XX , where XX is a number) and a description of the improvements you made.
 * If you currently have a score of zero on at least three assignments, you can redo two. Include links and descriptions for both.
 * If you like all your grades and don’t want to redo anything that’s okay. Submit a txt/md file here saying that.

Team notes:

 * Some assignments this semester have been partner assignments.
 * The instructions for this assignment involve resubmitting new solutions for old assignments.
 * That means those new submissions will be regraded for the old assignment, effecting the score for both partners on that assignment.
 * Either partner chooses to redo an partner assignment, the other partner may work with them on that while still choosing a different assignment to redo themselves.
 * Partners will benefit from the new grade whether they help or not.
 * This does create a strategic incentive for multi-student planning. Have fun.
