# CS4310 Assignments

Hello! ðŸ™‚ This is a course! This is an open course on operating systems! Project one is expected to be completed after homework six, and project two after homework nine. Provided are compressed files containing starter code for each assignment in the 'starter' directory, assignment descriptions in the 'md' directory, and solutions in the 'solutions' directory. Some assignments begin with optional starter code in Rust instead of C. Feel free to move through the material at your own pace.
